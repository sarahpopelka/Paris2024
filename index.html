          <h2>Project</h2>
          <p>The project aims to equip the IOC and the Paris city government with a technological tool that will provide
            an exceptional event experience to both Parisians and visitors attending the Paris 2024 Olympic Games. The
            Paris 2024 app thoughtfully and creatively mobilizes elements of Paris's "city power": its existing app
            infrastructure (borrowing in concept from the <i>pass sanitaire</i>), the ideology of the Olympic Games
            (striving toward social and environmental sustainability), Paris's economic positioning (as a major
            destination for tourism and culture), and bearing in mind the City's legal limitations (including the fact
            that Paris is bound to the General Data Protection Regulation), in order to strengthen the utility of the
            application and propmote its by the IOC, the city of Paris, and the multicultural users. The app strives to
            protect the public, athletes and staff from health and safety risks, while respecting privacy, autonomy, and
            culutral heterogeneity. This tool provides the public with multiple functions that will facilitate access to
            events, transportation and mobility in Paris, updates on the Olympics, health recommendations, and security
            information.</p>

            Lastly, and in accordance with the "Sport can save lives" message of the IOC and the WHO, the app aims to
            raise awareness of the importance of physical activity for both physical and mental health, in addition to
            its benefits for wellbeing and cognitive development. The user can view fitness related messaging at each
            app login.

              <h3>Situational Awareness > Operational Efficiency</h3>
              <p>
                In a world where unpredictable threats can materialize in an instant, the The Paris 2024 app puts
                realtime data in the hands of decisionmakers, to allow for rapid and efficient reponse when problems
                arise. The associated Emergency Operations Center (EOC) dashboard comes equipped with realtime
                intelligence on the attendance of each event and the Olympic Games as a whole (derived from the
                application), weather forecasting, transportation information (including congestion, transit on-time
                performance, etc.), public safety calls for service, emergency room capacities and wait times, and the
                location and nature of the reports/requests made through the Paris2024 app. This data, overlayed with a dense GIS, allows city officials and event organizers to adjust operations on a dime, should any planning need arise.
                <br>
                <br>
                We set out to build an app that would provide cutting edge information sharing and emergency response
                capabilities while still fulfilling user needs and respecting user privacy. This starts with the secure
                in-app identity verification and ticketing features, which make event attendance at the Games more
                streamlined and secure. This also guarantees that all attendees will have the app downloaded, which is
                crucial in case of an emergency. Secondly, the app consolidates FAQs and information resources on
                anything from Paris transportation to COVID-19 testing in over 100 languages, making it easy to manage
                and access for organizers and users alike. It also serves as a channel to communicate any updates or
                health and safety alerts, and health recommendations, associated with sport. Finally, the in-app
                emergency reporting tool allows for organizers to gather and sort information on situations of concern
                directly from attendees, who will be prompted to classify the incident by type, severity, and location,
                facilitating the triage process for the security team, and reporting the most relevant information to
                the competent authorities. Users may also opt to share their locations in a crisis situation. The app is
                built with privacy and cybersecurity in mind, and strictly complies with GDPR guidelines.

                  No, you will not be required to submit any medical or health information in order to attend the

                  added value to implementing an active disease surveillance mechanism. However, your contact
                  information will be tied to your check-in at each event. If it happens that a concerning COVID-19
                  variant is linked to an event that you attended, you agree to have public health officials reach out

                  ID verification is used to ensure that the IOC has complete and accurate information on every attendee
                  at the games. This is necessary for two reasons. First, as an accountability mechanism to ensure that
                  no one is inappropriately gaining attendance to the games. Secondly, having complete and accurate
                  information assists responders in the event of a disaster (allowing responders to make sure that every
                  attendee is present and accounted for following an adverse event), and as part of disease surveillance
                  (allowing for contact tracing in the event that a new variant appears). We do not take citizenship or
                  visa status into account, simply identifying information. A copy of your ID will not be stored with
                  your record following verification; instead, a field stating "ID verified" will be attached to your
                  record and visible to IOC/event staff.

                  After the olympic games, all personal information will be stored in a secure database for one year, in
                  case it is needed to support contact tracing/ disease surveillance efforts. All other data will be
                  de-identified and utilized in aggregate form, in order to aid in post-event reporting/ metrics, as
                  well as to help improve the operations of future Olympic Games. The data may be made public, so that
                  researchers, planners, and entrepreneurs can benefit from it in their work, but the publicly available
                  data will again be scrubbed of any identifying information and only present relevant variables, in
                  line with current open data standards.

                  A variety of algorithms are used in the processing of your data and the functioning of the app. For
                  one thing, due to the sheer scale of review that would be necessary, an algorithm is used to verify
                  your identification information. This algorithm uses image processing to pull text-based data from the
                  image that you upload and compare it to the data that you enter at registration. Due to the poor
                  functionality of facial recognition algortihms, particularly with non-white individuals, your ID photo
                  will not be taken into consideration in the ID verification process. For the navigation portion of the
                  application, an algorithm will be used to suggest socially sustainable businesses to you, based on
                  your location and search terms. For the report a problem functionality of the applicaiton, an
                  algorithm will be used to triage your request, based on the details you provide, so that responders
                  are provided with the most pressing issues for review first. The translation services also utilize an
                  algortihm to aid in real-time, rapid translation.

                  Cybersecurity is a top priority for us and for the Olympic games. For this reason, we collect only the
                  strictly necessary information, and store it securely for only a limited amount of time after the
                  Games. In the case of a data breach, all users will be notified expeditiously.

                  You will be required to turn on emergency app notifications from the IOC for the duration of the
